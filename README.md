- ðŸŒ± My career aim description:

Hey Its me, Aaradhya Gopal, from Nepal.
A Flutter Developer with strong passion for developing mobile app with love and passion.

My career ambition is to become a Senior FullStack Mobile Developer and Mobile DevSecOps, mainly focused on remote opportunities.
Additionally, I want to launch my own mobile apps published on the Play Store and App Store.
Lastly, Iâ€™m keen to explore part-time teaching roles to build a network, which is often missing in remote jobs.


Primary Work Stacks
--------------------
Flutter: My current full-time focus and first passion. Even if I move to another field, Iâ€™ll keep building personal apps with Flutter.

Go: My backend stack of choice for personal side projects during my 20s. Itâ€™s my first step toward transitioning my career in my 30s.

DevOps: Focused on managing production environments. After moving into backend work in my 30s, this will be my next step to become a well-rounded professional with server and infrastructure expertise.

Pro Stacks
----------
Python: Used for automation, utility scripting, data analysis, and small freelance gigs. I want to become proficient enough to create FastAPI backends when needed, develop smart tools, and apply my MSc in IT with a data analyst focus in practical scenarios.

Rust: Targeted for command-line tools, IoT, and processing large datasets. Itâ€™s not something Iâ€™ll use frequently but a valuable skill to build gradually over time.
