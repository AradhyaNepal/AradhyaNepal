- 🌱 My career aim description:

Hey Its me, Aaradhya Gopal, from Nepal.
A Flutter Developer with strong passion for developing mobile app with love and passion.

My career ambition is to become a Senior FullStack Mobile Developer and Mobile DevSecOps, mainly focused on remote opportunities.
Additionally, I want to launch my own mobile apps published on the Play Store and App Store.
Lastly, I’m keen to explore part-time teaching roles to build a network, which is often missing in remote jobs.

Flutter: Currently working full-time. Mobile development is my lifelong commitment. Flutter is my tool, but my main drive is mastering mobile deeply.

Go: My chosen backend stack for personal side-projects.

DevOps: I’ve covered essential DevOps skills to manage Mobile, Backend, and Frontend production. Understanding backend systems in-depth enhances my Mobile DevOps and FullStack path.

Database: Going deeper into PostgreSQL and MongoDB. I’ve basic knowledge of other DB options like graph databases. Even if Go doesn’t work out, advanced DB skills can pivot me into another backend stack.

Python: For automation, utility scripts, AI exploration, and small freelance projects. I aim to be capable enough to build Django backends when needed, make smart tools, and stay relevant in the fast-moving tech landscape.
