- ðŸŒ± My career aim description:

Hey Its me, Aaradhya Gopal Nepal.
A Flutter Developer with strong passion for developing mobile app with love and passion.

But as I keep working in Mobile, I am kinda feeling more interest in exploring Backend and Deployment.

How? By smooth transition from: 
Flutter -> Full Stack Mobile Developer -> Junior Backend Developer with Flutter as Freelance -> And one day near future:
Senior Lead Backend Developer at work |  My own Mobile Apps ideas in PlayStore and AppStore

Its called smooth, because the timeframe is 2037 AD (35 Yr Old Me).Thats freaking 12 year, but hey I am not just aiming to learn stacks, I am aiming to have mastery, it takes time; And currently due to my youth, I am a selfish Lead.

So:

My 5 Tech Stack (rather say 5 constrains for a GenZ guy on his most moody phase):

Which I calls: FlutterGo-DevOpsPro Journey

1) Flutter(Have Advance Expertise): Full Time Job. Give your best since in future you will build your own apps; not just simple app, a robust app.
2) Go(Aiming Advance): Thats the backend I choose to master and one day switch to it. Currently not trendy, but I aim for future. Challenge is how I will build experience on it, IDK.
3) DevOps(Aiming Basic): All expertise covered to deal with Mobile, Backend and Frontend Production Operation.
4) Database(Aiming Advance): Not basic, rather going advance.  Not just Mongo(NOSQL) and Postgresql(SQL), going all possible storage possible, like graph.
5) Python (Basic): Fun script to make my life easy; why use online PDF compression website when I can ask ChatGPT to give me python script. And for AI; I don't wanna loose the hype of AI, at least I can show off.
