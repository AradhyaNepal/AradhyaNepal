- 🌱 My career aim description:

Hey Its me, Aaradhya Gopal, from Nepal.
A Flutter Developer with strong passion for developing mobile app with love and passion.

My career ambition is to become a Senior FullStack Developer and DevSecOps, mainly focused on remote opportunities. To be full stack I will be working on Full Stack Mobile in 20s simultaneously building backend projects, then in 30s switch to backend and cloud, yet launching my own mobile apps and publishing them on the Play Store and App Store.


Primary Work Stacks
--------------------
Flutter: My current full-time focus and first passion. Even if I move to another field, I’ll keep building personal apps with Flutter.

Go: My backend stack of choice for personal side projects during my 20s. It’s my first step toward transitioning my career in my 30s.

DevOps: Focused on managing production environments. After moving into backend work in my 30s, this will be my next step to become a well-rounded professional with server and infrastructure expertise.

Pro Stacks
----------
Python: Used for automation, utility scripting, data analysis, and small freelance gigs. I want to become proficient enough to create FastAPI backends when needed, develop smart tools, and apply my MSc in IT with a data analyst focus in practical scenarios.

Rust: Targeted for command-line tools, IoT, and processing large datasets. It’s not something I’ll use frequently but a valuable skill to build gradually over time.
