- 🔭 I’m currently working in CodeHimalaya as a Flutter Developer

- 🌱 My career summary in a nutshell (As of 2024 Feb):
    - Specialist in Flutter Framework, but not limited to the framework, wanna be known as Mobile developer regardless of tech stack used.
    - Also learning and developing personal projects on .Net Core as backend. Bcz I wanna be Generalist on many but Specialist on one (Mobile).
    - After learning .Net, I will also learn about Blockchain.
    - I am learning these 3 frameworks by practically working on my PocketA3 Project (both backend and mobile-desktop).
    - The PocketA3 application is a re-making of my bachelor FYP.
    - It is a Self Productive application tailored  for me, but in the future will be a multiplayer openly available app.

    - But wanna go for teaching and wanna do FYP supervising if I get an opportunity to do so.
