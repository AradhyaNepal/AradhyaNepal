- ðŸŒ± My career aim description:

Hey Its me, Aaradhya Gopal, from Nepal.
A Flutter Developer with strong passion for developing mobile app with love and passion.

My career ambition is to become a Senior FullStack Mobile Developer and Mobile DevSecOps, mainly focused on remote opportunities.
Additionally, I want to launch my own mobile apps published on the Play Store and App Store.
Lastly, Iâ€™m keen to explore part-time teaching roles to build a network, which is often missing in remote jobs.

Flutter: Currently working full-time. Mobile development is my lifelong commitment. Flutter is my tool, but my main drive is mastering mobile deeply.

Go: My chosen backend stack for personal side-projects.

DevOps: Iâ€™ve covered essential DevOps skills to manage Mobile, Backend, and Frontend production. Understanding backend systems in-depth enhances my Mobile DevOps and FullStack path.

Database: Going deeper into PostgreSQL and MongoDB. Iâ€™ve basic knowledge of other DB options like graph databases. Even if Go doesnâ€™t work out, advanced DB skills can pivot me into another backend stack.

Python: For automation, utility scripts, AI exploration, and small freelance projects. I aim to be capable enough to build Django backends when needed, make smart tools, and stay relevant in the fast-moving tech landscape.
